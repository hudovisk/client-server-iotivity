How to build
============

We use the scons script provided in the iotivity. To build it go to iotivity root folder and execute:
```
scons resource/csdk/stack/samples/arduino/SimpleClientServer/ \
 TARGET_OS=arduino TARGET_ARCH=arm BOARD=arduino_due_x \
 TARGET_TRANSPORT=BLE
```

The sample code must be replaced or modified to upload your code.
